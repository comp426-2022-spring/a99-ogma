# a99 Final Project: Ogma
This webite is developed by the Ogma Team. Our goal for this website is to make a digital journal where users can rate their days and log what they are currently feeling. Journaling is a great way to release what you're feeling and is a way to process what you're feeling. In these unprecedented times, it's important to have a place where you can release and process what you feel, and this is what we set out to make.

## Summary 

This project is a functional "mental health journal" website. Users can log into their accounts and write journal entries describing how they feel. They can also rank how they feel on a numbered scale. Users can view their past entries and account information. They can change their username and password, using their email as their primary ID. Finally, users can delete their account, as well. External mental health resources are linked in the "Resources" page, gathered from https://www.mentalhealth.gov/.
